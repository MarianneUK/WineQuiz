# 1. User Experience (UX) development process
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

According to Jesse James Garrett, the user experience development process is all about ensuring that no aspect of the user’s experience with your site happens without your conscious, explicit intent. This means taking into account every possibility of every action the user is likely to take and understanding the user’s expectations at every step of the way through that process.

  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

According to [WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/wireframing-benefits/), wireframes give web developers a clear path of what has to be done. It clarifies the direction and objectives of the site build and allows for better decision-making as to which web technologies, techniques and processes should be used in order to achieve an excellent result.

For this project, wireframes were created using Adobe XD. All wireframes were shown to the client for approval, prior to starting the website development.

# 4. Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents) 

## Manual Testing

The site has been tested on various browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox, on multiple devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile.
The site has also been shared with the client to gather her feedback.

Below is the testing process for all pages on desktop and mobile versions:

### All pages:

- Start quiz
    - When selecting "Home", the browser redirects to the Home page. The text in the navigation bar is highlighted with a gray background for ease of navigation. Internal link works as expected.
- Questions 
    - When selecting "Music", the browser redirects to the Music page. The text in the navigation bar is highlighted with a gray background for ease of navigation. Internal link works as expected.
- Exit quiz 
    - When selecting "Story", the browser redirects to the Story page. The text in the navigation bar is highlighted with a gray background for ease of navigation. Internal link works as expected.
- Results 
    - When selecting "Contact", the browser redirects to the Contact page. The text in the navigation bar is highlighted with a gray background for ease of navigation. Internal link works as expected.

- Text:
    - All text is in the correct and consistent size, font and color. Text has also been checked for typos.

  - Media:
    - All images load on the page. All images have alt text equivalent in a contrasted color if not loading or for visually impaired users. Working as expected.

  - Responsiveness:
    - Responsiveness has been more challenging than expected. After adding all media queries, the site was not behaving accordingly. While testing on various viewport, I noticed that previously centered elements would move out of their original places. From now on, I will start with a mobile-first design and work my way up to wider viewports.


## Automated testing
